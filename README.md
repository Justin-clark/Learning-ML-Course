# Learning-ML-Course

Followed along on an introduction to Machine Learning Course using scikit-learn on egghead.io. The course went over common machine learning algorithms that don't include neural networks. Goes over models, classification, regression and accuracy scores.

I don't take credit for the provided code, it was more for the learning experience.
